# Installation

Clone this repository on your local machine:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:fbsamples/original-coast-clothing.git
$ cd original-coast-clothing
```

You will need:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 10.x or higher
- Remote server service such as [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), a local tunneling service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), or your own webserver.

# Usage

## Using ngrok

#### 1. Install tunneling service

If not already installed, install ngrok via [download](https://ngrok.com/download) or via command line:

```bash
npm install -g ngrok
```

In the directory of this repo, request a tunnel to your local server with your preferred port
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

The screen should show the ngrok status:

```
Session Status                online

                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```
Note the https URL of the external server that is fowarded to your local machine. In the above example, it is `https://1c3b838deacb.ngrok.io`.

#### 2. Install the dependencies

Open a new terminal tab, also in the repo directiory. 

```bash
$ npm install
```

Alternatively, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):

```bash
$ yarn install
```

#### 3. Set up .env file

Copy the file `.sample.env` to `.env`

```bash
cp .sample.env .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to add all the values for your app and page. Note that `APP_URL` will be the external URL from step 1. 

#### 4. Run your app locally

```bash
node app.js
```

You should now be able to access the application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 

Confirm that you canalso access it at the external URL from step 1.

#### 5. Configure your webhook subcription and set the Messenger profile

Use the `VERIFY_TOKEN` that you created in `.env` file and call the **/profile** endpoint in your browser or via cURL:
```
http://localhost:3000/profile?mode=all&verify_token=verify-tokenl
```

This will configure your webhook. 

#### 6. Test that your app setup is successful

Send a message to your Page from Facebook or in Messenger. 

You should see the webhook called in the ngrok terminal tab, and in your application terminal tab. 

If you see a response to your message in messenger, you have fully set up your app! Voilà!

## Using Heroku

Download and install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

#### 2. Create an app from the CLI

```bash
heroku apps:create
# Creating app... done, ⬢ mystic-wind-83
# Created http://mystic-wind-83.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:mystic-wind-83.git
```
